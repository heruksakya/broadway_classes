a = "Hello World"
print(len(a)) # Returns the length of a sequence / iterable

print(bool(a)) # Here is a non-empty string which is truthy. So it gives True

print(slice(1, 5)) # slice() function can be used in the string slicing. First parameter is start and second is stop
# slice(start, stop, step) # Step can also be provided as a third parameter

print(type(a)) # This returns type of the object inside the fxn. Here it is string
